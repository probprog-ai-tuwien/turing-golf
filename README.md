# Golfing with Turing.jl

Install requirements by entering the package manager in a REPL with `]`
```
add package
```
or
```
import Pkg
Pkg.add(package)
```

Minimal requirements to run inference:
```
ForwardDiff
Turing
```

For plotting install
```
PyCall
PyPlot
```
and setup PyCall, see [PyPlot.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyPlot.jl)

To run interactively, see [IJulia.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) and [jupyter-lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
